# F-V-profiling

This tool has been designed to help achieve proper data acquisition (i.e. you can use it during testing) and analysis (i.e. you can use it after testing). 

Please note that there are different versions of this tool for force-velocity analysis, load-velocity analysis and torque-velocity analysis. 

Here are some basic instructions that should be read before using this tool. 
However these are basic instructions, and the analysis of the force-velocity, load-velocity or torque-velocity relationship is complex and requires a minimum level of expertise, so it is recommended that you consult the literature on the topic. 

Here you have some recommended readings:

On the shape of the force-velocity relationship: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31275173/ 			

Comparison of linear, hyperbolic and double-hyperbolic models: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32255757/
